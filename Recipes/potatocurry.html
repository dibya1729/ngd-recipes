    <h1>Potato Curry</h1>
    <img src="potato.jpg" alt="Potato Curry">
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Potato curry, a flavorful and hearty dish, begins with peeling and cubing potatoes.
        The preparation starts by heating oil in a pan and adding cumin seeds, allowing them to sizzle and release their aroma.
        Finely chopped onions are then saut√©ed until golden brown, followed by the addition of minced garlic and ginger.
        Spices such as turmeric, coriander, cumin, and chili powder are added and toasted briefly to enhance their flavors.
        Tomatoes, either chopped or pureed, are added next, cooking until they soften and blend with the spices to form a rich base.
        The cubed potatoes are then added to the mixture, coating them well with the spice blend.
        Water or broth is poured in to cover the potatoes, and the curry is simmered until the potatoes are tender and the sauce has thickened.
        The dish is often garnished with fresh cilantro and served hot with rice or bread.</p>
